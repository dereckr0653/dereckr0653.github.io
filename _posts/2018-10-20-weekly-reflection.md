I have learned how to make shapes into each other and i get how the contract works as you have to say what shape overlays the shape and the position of the shape as you need those for the computer to follow your instructions as if you don't all of the sode after willl be wrong.We have also learned how to get unique shapes like a shape you can't make on computer with code we know right now.I know i am having trobel with placing the right code in the right spots like i could'nt make 3 shapes togeter.I feel like we need i reference sheet because even though we learn from eachother it always the best way.I am trying to learn and probly need extra help.I feel a sif i am learning but not as fsat as the whole class.
