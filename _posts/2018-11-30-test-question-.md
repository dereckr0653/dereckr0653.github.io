I am focusing on the test question 9 or on version 2 it is 17.The question is Which contract matches the test cases below?This question is for mastery skill 1 as the contract is in the question and the contract are like trems the computer uses to understan a function and also for us to understand it.The correct answer is b as it gave the right contract of it above as the examples tell us what the contract is.In this question you had to look at all the examples firat to see what its the same and know the terms of data like string and number data.Most of the students got it right but some people chose D and that was that answer a,b and c were wrong.I think they could have done this because they had troble idenifying the data given to them making them not understan and say it was wrong.The amount of people that got it right was 60% and that is ok.If you had troble will mastery skill one you maybe got this wrong because this was Prac level meaning that you needed more than one step and if you didn't know your contracts and how to form data it as the examples gave the data and if you didn't know how to get data from these functions you cound not have known the data giving your answer D and that was the wrong answer.I feel that this question  depended if you know how to form contracts and get the data it is telling you because this question is making sure you understand what is on the screen as in computer science that is kind of hard because of the different types of data and steps it takes to make a contract.I think this question just determinds if you know how to read the functions give as you can make a contract out of any function given to you and this question is no different from understaning what is on the computer meaning to just need to study the terms and what finding the contract means when finding data.
