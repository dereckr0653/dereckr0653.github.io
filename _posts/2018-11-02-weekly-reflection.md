We learned the contrats for funtions this week.The actives we did this weekend it help us learned the contract of a funtion and what a contract is.A contract the the way a computer reads the funtion as the compter follows the contract you give it but it has to be very sepific as the the computer does not understan all the language we know.We also learned how to make inifinty shapes with code that when you put in the number it gives that size of the shape.It does not have to be the size it just has to be something you can change in the funtion.We learn how to interpret funtions to get contarts and what they might mean as we had to give on own idea of funtions and say what they mean.The whole point is that we are learning to get contrats better or the pesies of the code that the computer reads so we can understan what the compuer sees making it easyer to write code because we would know the right way to put a funtion.
