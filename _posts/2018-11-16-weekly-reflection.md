We learned this week on how the computer reads the expression we give it as our class went over the computer sees.We defined most off the terms we know for the computer like string and how they allow us to put things togeter that aren't defined.We also learned why some functions would be wrong if they did have certain marks or not.A example like
```(sqare 50 solid red)```
This would not work because their are no paracentesis the computer will think it is a variable and not a string function or value.This is also why we use the fast functions as we have to use contracts,examples, and defineing.We will use contracts to tell us the terms we need to use and what won't work as we would get the name we need to use.
