We learned this week on how the computer reads the expression we give it as our class went over the computer sees.We defined most off the terms we know for the computer like string and how they allow us to put things togeter that aren't defined.We also learned why some functions would be wrong if they did have certain marks or not.A example like
```(sqare 50 solid red)```
This would not work because their are no paracentesis the computer will think it is a variable and not a string function or value.This is also why we use the fast functions as we have to use contracts,examples, and defineing.We will use contracts to tell us the terms we need to use and what won't work as we would get the name we need to use.We also use examples to show how we can use this function in a different way.All of these terms relate because it is part of JavaScript and is the computers language meaning if we say a term for the computer wrong it can't accept that function.Every symbol in a function are there for a reason as parasites are for labeling your function and what should go in there.The contract tells you the terms we should put in like a string,number,image values and will help you tiger out what to do next for the function as you will know what values to put in if you have the contract correct.Another thing we earned this week was how code and computers can be used for real life situations.We got the information that a rocket was blasting off and we all had similar questions putting them into groups like how the computer uses terms to know what to say.This show h9w important this week was to understanding the  code in our eyes and the computers eyes.
