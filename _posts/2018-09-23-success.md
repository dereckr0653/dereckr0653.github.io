I found my self stuck on this project.I asked many people for help but for many people it was like i was speaking another language. 
I know moving forward I have to pay attention to details especially spaces and letters. The computer is like a car and the gas has to be perfect 
in order for it to work. I was really proud to see my post and site up. Thank you to everyone that help me and i will be paying extra attention moving forward. This was challemgimg but i am
proud to say I perservered. Also terminology is a big big deal!
