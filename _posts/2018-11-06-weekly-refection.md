My flag was the Puerto rico flag and this flag had many shapes in it.The size of my flag was 2 hoist and 3 in fly.The flag had a triangle that had a rotation of 90 degrees going clock wise taking up about one half of the flag.In the middel of the triangle is a star with 5 sides.There were also strips on the flag.There were 5 strips as the frist one would be red and the next one would be white.That was the pattern of the strips on my flag.This means I would have to make a larger flag because in this project we can not use the scale function so i think i would scale my flag to  hoist of 10 and a fly of 12.This would make it so on the computer i would not have to use the scale function.
Part 2
What shapes make your flag?When on paper what was hardest about making the flag was making it into simple shapes as the program only uses simple shapes so i first put the canton of the flag first and when i had to put the strips you can not do it perfect so i had to do it again but i did not have enough time.Some of the challenges were what order to put them in as it mattered alot.If you did not put them in the right order your flag would look like a mess.You would also need to get the right measurement so your flag did not look werid as some people chose harder flags with harder shapes to cut out.Next time that i do this it will keep in mind how you do not need to think to hard as it is very simple so i will not over think it next time.
