We learned this week that the computer is like a person signing a contract as if we don't give it specific instructions it isn't compatible to the computer and won't accept the code that it is given like when making a directory as even one mistake in spelling a mistake i made before and my entire website did not work.This shows how the computer can only agree to certain terms.
