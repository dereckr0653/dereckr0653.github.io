This week weeir is a learned pair programming as it is a style of programming used by professional to solve difficult problems.Their is this project we did on thursday where me and a partner had to create shapes but with other shapes in them so there would be like a circle in a square and we made it.This makes sence why we learned circles of evaluation at the beggining of the year bcause if we didn't we would not understand where to put the parentheses or where to put the numbers.The equation he gave to help us eith    
pair programming also had to do with the position on the screen lesson as their is a position on the screen as there is a limit whee you can put an object.I feel i am doing good in class as when i don't know something there are people in class that will help me.I am getting better with the terms as i am rembering more stuff.I am defintely doing better than when i first started as i am getting a better grade and understaning things without even explaining it.I feel the people in class keep me on track as i am way more precise with code as i have learnd to follow the contract.
