This class can be very hard if you don't listen to what the notes or teacher is saying like when he was teaching us how to make a diretory.I have learned to get all the details from the notes and how to make files,diretory,and folders.At frist I was stuck and then if you read closely your able to do it.The biggest challenge was understaning it all like html or what .md means so when puting it down i did'nt know what it meant untill you read the code and the list.
