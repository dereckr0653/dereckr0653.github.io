I learned how every thing has to be exact like your repository name is very important or eles the computer won't get your commands.You also need the right directory or you can't do certain commands and is very important to put slash'es or you can't make folders.You would need your repository to be public for anyone to even see your repository.You also need Jekyll witch basiclly re-generates all the HTML pages every time you commit one.When you closely look at the note to complete the website you willl learn things like .md and it means markdown.The whole point is i learned to look at notes better and understan what they mean as in this lesson they giude you to make your github.website.
