We have learned alot about computer science over the past 6 weeks.The first week we had to create a github account and make a website.We were told to do exaclty what the instructions told us and at first i had a hard time but we learned one of the most important lessons and that was to be very speific with the code you do as any wrong typeing error was an error that would led the whole website to fail and not work but with rechecking it i was fainlly able to complete it knowing that you can't summerize code you have to apply it exactly the way it is.Then after that week we learned what a agrument was in code and it describe something like the size.There were also strings and they gave it the adjectives of the image we had as for them to be a string they needed a parenties t be a string as they a need to be in order to.If you wanted a shape to be red you need them to be in order like you cannot put "der" you would need to put red for a red color.We also learned a little in the 3rd week about circle of evalution as we used them to do math so when making real code we would know where to put parenties and the funtion that would be like the operation.We have been given a lot of definitions and code always means something like how the code <li> means to list a item that has to be a ul or il. Their is always a definition for any code as you should also know if you put a ; in a line of code it is a comment as it is a place to write or if you just want to know what that code means you could write that their and the program will ignore it. Definition and the circles of evaluation are very similar as when you put code like (+ 2 8) it means 2+8 that has a total of 10.That code would also be a expression of how to get 10.In one of our projects we had to put shape together and make shapes with certain shapes in it and we had to define it. When we did it we had to make sure we had to define it because the code could only do apply 2 shapes at a time so when we define it then we would have a another shape to apply to it. We also learned about contracts on how they had to do exactly what they had to do or eyes the computer can't read it like when you have a extra letter in a expression the computer can't accept the contract or the code. Me and my classmates have also done something called pair programming as professionals use it to solve difficult problems as 2 people share one computer and both of us focus on different parts of the code. I think I have learned how to absorb more information than ever be for making these weekly reflections. I know I have learned alot over the 6 weeks I have been here and feel I have grown alot from the first day i came.
